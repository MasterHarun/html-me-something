                            <p>Somewhere deep in the beautiful landscape of a small little country called Bosnia a thought was brought upon the universe. This thought wasn't much during the time but eventually grew to become something bigger than even the originator could of imagined.</p>
                            <p>Bosnia is a small country with an expanse of history stemming through the dark ages. Its people grew and cultivated a land and culture that has stood the test of time.</p>

Wether the inhabitants believe it or not the thing we call an experience was already set forth in motion long before it was thought of in the mind.</p>
                            <p>To think we have ultimate control of our life is to be blinded by the mind. A single point of will has the power to change the course of the world and how you experience it.</p>
